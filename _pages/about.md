About me
======
I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Penn State, advised by Dr. Chaopeng Shen. My research focuses on global-scale hydrological simulation using differentiable models, which includes the rainfall-runoff process and channel routing.
